# About

This preset adds [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) to a fresh Laravel application.

It can be the foundation of a preset based on Tailwind CSS, such as the [TALL preset](https://github.com/use-preset/tall) or the [Inertia one](https://github.com/use-preset/inertia), or can be used as a standalone preset.

# Installation

This preset is intended to be installed into a fresh Laravel application. Follow the [Laravel installation instructions](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/installation) to ensure you have a working environment before continuing.

**Then, run the following command**:

```bash
npx use-preset laravel-tailwindcss
```

# Authentication

An authentication scaffolding is available under the `--auth` flag. It will require `laravel/ui` and the Blade templates from the [official Tailwind CSS preset](https://github.com/laravel-frontend-presets/tailwindcss).

This functionality has been added to match the official Tailwind CSS preset's functionalities, but will be updated in the future:

- It will get rid of `laravel/ui` by using [single-action controllers](https://driesvints.com/blog/the-beauty-of-single-action-controllers/)
- The templates will be remade from scratch

# Modifications

This preset gets rid of SASS and uses PostCSS instead. Nesting rules and importing files is still possible. If you are using Tailwind CSS, you really shouldn't need more than that, hence the riddance of SASS.

- Removal of the `sass` and`sass-loader` dependencies
- Removal of the `resources/sass` directory and its content
- Addition of `tailwindcss`, `@tailwindcss/ui`, `@tailwindcss/typography`, `postcss-import` and `postcss-nested`
- Addition of `app.css`, `base.css` and `components.css` in `resources/css`
- Addition of `postcss.config.js` and `tailwind.config.js`
- Modification of `webpack.mix.js`
- Modification of `resources/views/welcome.blade.php`

# To-do

- Move authentication scaffolding to [single-action controllers](https://driesvints.com/blog/the-beauty-of-single-action-controllers/)
- Refactor the templates from the [official Tailwind CSS preset](https://github.com/laravel-frontend-presets/tailwindcss) ones to custom ones
